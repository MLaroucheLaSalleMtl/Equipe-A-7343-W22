Thanks for downloading MATH DONUTS by caffeen. 
You can get more caffeen fonts at:
http://www.JESSERIFIC.com

And for an even bigger selection of fonts, I
encourage you to check out two of my favourite
font sites on the net:
http://www.fontsnthings.com
http://www.fontfreak.com

You can use the font as much as you like for
free. If you use MATH DONUTS to make anything
really cool, I wanna hear about it!

Enjoy!
Jesse
